#Cluster analysis

#First let's visualize the data (from https://uc-r.github.io/kmeans_clustering)

distance <- get_dist(df[,7:20]) #Calculate Euclidean distance from factoextra package
fviz_dist(distance, gradient = list(low = "#00AFBB", mid = "white", high = "#FC4E07"))

#That's a hot mess (too many rows), but there does seem to be some clustering in the dataset.


#Figure out optimal number of clusters (from https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/determining-the-optimal-number-of-clusters-3-must-know-methods/)

#We'll compare several methods to look for consensus

#This uses the elbow method to determine number of clusters
fviz_nbclust(df[,c()], FUNcluster = kmeans, method = 'wss') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4, linetype = 2)+
  labs(subtitle = "Elbow method") # 4 clusters

# Silhouette method
fviz_nbclust(df[,7:20], kmeans, method = "silhouette")+
  labs(subtitle = "Silhouette method") #2 clusters

# Gap statistic
# nboot = 50 to keep the function speedy. 
# recommended value: nboot= 500 for your analysis.
# Use verbose = FALSE to hide computing progression.
set.seed(123)
fviz_nbclust(df[,7:20], kmeans, nstart = 25,  method = "gap_stat", nboot = 50)+
  labs(subtitle = "Gap statistic method") #10 (probably doesn't resolve)

#These don't seem to be clustering well. 

#Let's just visualize with a PCA

PCA <-prcomp(df[,7:20])

biplot(PCA, choices = c(1,2)) #First two axes
biplot(PCA, choices = c(2,3)) #second and third axes

#PCA looks legit, no weird shapes and lots of variance explained in the first axes (~86%!)

#Let's visualize it with the colors from our land use types.
